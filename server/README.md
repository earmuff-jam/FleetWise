## Psql Container and Docker

- Using Dockerfile to interpret the postgres database
- Provide configurations from Dockerfile alongside environmental variables.
- Provide a starter script to load mashed application into the system.
- To simply run the psql container `docker compose up`.
- To build and re-pull the image please follow docker docs setup.
- Depending on your requirement, we have both the traditional approach and the newer approach with docker compose.
